# Overview
A Pattern Game I developed just for fun !

# Description  
Memorize the pattern in which blocks light up and re-iterate the pattern accurately to finish the level;


HOW TO START: 
  1. CLICK ON INDEX.HTML FILE TO RUN THE GAME;
  
  
Here are the rules : 
  1. There are four blocks on the screen, a button below that says lets play, and a text stating current level = 1;
  2. Click on the Lets Play Button to start the game;
  3. For level One, one of the four blocks will light up for short span with random color; Memorize the block which lit up;
  4. Now click on the same block that lit up to clear the level; You have finished level one! Hmm, that was easy !???
  
  5. As you move to level two, this is where the things start to get interesting; Click on lets Play again to start level two; 
  6. At level 2, two random blocks will light up twice out of the four, they can be same or different; Try to memorize the sequence in  which they lit;
  7. After the two blinks, give  a brief pause for 2 seconds, and then try to re-iterate the sequence in which the blocks blinked;
  8. As you clear a level, an alert will tell you wether your response was correct or wrong;
  9. If your response was incorrect, the current level will reset to level=1 , and the game restarts, otherwise, the level keeps on increasing;
  
  
  HAVE FUN, 
  THE HIGHEST LEVEL I COULD REACH WAS LEVEL 8;
